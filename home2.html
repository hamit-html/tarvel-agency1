            <p>Rates are confidential and must not be disclosed or used in negotiations with a hotel or supplier.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to amend all rates quoted due to changes in government taxes. Any such charges will affect new and existing bookings for passengers who have yet to stay at the hotel or utilize the service.</p>

        <section class="hotel-reservation-rules">
            <h2>Hotel Reservation Rules</h2>
            <p>Our booking engine can be used solely for individual customers up to 9 PAX or 5 rooms. The reservation offers to allocate single, double, triple, or quadruple rooms for a maximum of five people.</p>
            <p>Hotel rates are per room per night and based on single, double, triple, and quad occupancy, as applicable.</p>
            <p>The hotel has the right to cancel bookings made for more than 9 PAX or 5 rooms from the same agent and similar dates or modify rates and booking conditions.</p>
            <p>During fair periods or specific events, the maximum number of PAX rule doesn’t apply, and the hotel has the right to cancel, modify rates, and booking conditions after confirmation.</p>
            <p>All information and pictures provided by the hotels are accurate. However, we cannot be held responsible if the results are inaccurate or incomplete.</p>

                <h2>Flight Reservation Rules</h2>
                <h3>Booking of Air Tickets</h3>
                <p>All booking requisitions must contain clear, accurate, and specific information required for issuing correct tickets. Tickets, once issued, are conclusive and binding unless discrepancies are reported within the same working day.</p>
                
                <h3>Obligations</h3>
                <p>It is your responsibility to notify us of any changes to your representatives, and we are not liable for bookings made by unauthorized persons.</p>
    
                <h3>Customer Warranties</h3>
                <p>By submitting booking information, the customer warrants that all facts are true, complete, and accurate. The customer has verified the passenger's credentials and complied with applicable laws. The customer agrees to abide by airline terms and conditions.</p>
    
                <h3>Ticket Terms</h3>
                <p>Unless otherwise stated, fares are non-refundable, non-transferable, and non-assignable. Once purchased, tickets cannot be changed. The customer is responsible for ensuring compliance with the airline’s terms and conditions.</p>

        <section class="pending-reservations">
            <h2>Pending Reservations</h2>
            <p>In some cases, the hotel may appear as available in the search results, but once the booking is made, the final status may show as pending. This is due to the allotment being booked by another agency just before your booking is processed or due to technical issues.</p>
            <p>A booking is confirmed only when the status is marked as "confirmed".</p>
            <p>If the status comes as pending, not-booked, or rejected, our reservation platform system operation team will contact you within 48 hours. We will do our best to reconfirm it; however, in some cases, it may not be possible, and we will ask you to book an alternative hotel.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="responsibility">
            <h2>Responsibility</h2>
            <p>Our reservation platform functions as an intermediary. We shall not be held responsible for any damages that may arise if the booking cannot be fulfilled due to catastrophic events, fire, earthquake, epidemic, flood, snowstorm, explosion, strike, riot, civil disturbance, war, act of God, or any failure or delay of transportation, power, or communication systems. These events cannot be linked to us or our system as acts of negligence.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="complaints">
            <h2>Complaints</h2>
            <p>In case of an emergency or any issue at the hotel/transfer, the agency or end customer must call the emergency phone number provided on their voucher or contact their agent. Please note that we will not consider any complaints or refunds if the customer does not call or does not get a slip from the hotel in case of problems with our services.</p>
            <p>Complaints must be reported to the hotel/service provider on the spot. We will not be held liable for any compensation for problems that could have been resolved during the passenger’s stay, had the hotel or service provider been made aware of them.</p>
            <p>If a dispute or claim arises, we should receive the complaint within 15 days from the last day of occupancy or the end of service. This is only applicable if the emergency number was called at the time of the problem. No claims will be accepted after this period.</p>
            <p>If the passenger leaves the hotel before the check-out date, an invoice will be issued for the full stay. If the hotel and the supplier confirm a reduction, our team will issue a credit note for the amount to be refunded. The passenger must ask for a written declaration from the hotel to confirm the exact date the stay was terminated and present this document to our sales team for the refund process.</p>
            <p>Any complaint that cannot be resolved at the hotel must be reported to our sales team, along with documentation from the hotel acknowledging the problem. Our sales team will respond within 5-30 working days, depending on the nature of the query.</p>
